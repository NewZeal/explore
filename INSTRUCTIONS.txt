Hi Erlan,

Your task is as follows:

Create a simple module from scratch with the following

- A .info.yml file (obviously)

- A Field formatter, which goes in /src/Plugin/Field/FieldFormatter and the filename has to have the same name as the
 class.  Follow the instructions here if you like: https://www.drupal
 .org/docs/8/creating-custom-modules/create-a-custom-field-formatter  . Make this field formatter apply to any short
 text field and places the text into a div as follows: <div class="my-format">[text here]</div>

- A preprocess function, which goes in the .module file.  When you install Drupal 8 it comes with an article content
type and a field called field_image.  Create a preprocess function for that field and a theme template to put in your
 theme that targets that field in the article content type (and not elsewhere).  Create a new variable to output in
 that twig template that displays the title of the node to which the image belongs.
 Suggestions:
 Use function
 function MODULENAME_preprocess_field(&$variables) {
 }

 Enable Devel module and use ksm() like this
 ksm($variables);

 Investigate the ksm output to find the object attached to the field

 Create an output variable like this
 $variables['title'] = $entity->get('title')->getValue()[0]['value'];

 Place that variable in the twig template



I don't expect you to know Drupal 8 inside and out which is why I have supplied most of the instructions for the task
.  There are just a few blanks for you to fill in.  Please document what you do and document the module in the manner
 which it is meant to be.

 When finished push the module and the template file to this repo so I can test it.

 Good luck
